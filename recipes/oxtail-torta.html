        An oxtail torta is a Mexican sandwich made with a crusty bread roll, often a telera or bolillo, that is filled with slow-cooked oxtail meat, typically seasoned with Mexican spices such as cumin, coriander, and chili powder. The oxtail meat is usually tender and flavorful, and it is often accompanied by toppings such as avocado, lettuce, tomato, and pickled onions. Some variations may also include cheese, mayo, or spicy sauces. The result is a delicious and hearty sandwich that is popular in Mexican cuisine.</p>
